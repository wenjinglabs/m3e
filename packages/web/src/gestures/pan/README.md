# m3e/gestures/pan

Recognizes continuous pointer movement and reports translation and velocity.

```ts
import { pan } from "m3e/gestures/pan";

const recognizer = pan({ activationMode: "move", lockAxis: "x" });
recognizer.addListener((detail) => {
  if (detail.phase === "update") console.log(detail.translationX);
});
```

## Declarative usage

```ts
import "m3e/gestures/pan";
```

```html
<div id="surface"></div>
<m3e-pan-gesture for="surface"></m3e-pan-gesture>
```

The element dispatches a `gesture` event with `PanGestureDetail` as its detail.
