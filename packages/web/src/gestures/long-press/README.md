# m3e/gestures/long-press

Recognizes a pointer held in place for a minimum duration.

```ts
import { longPress } from "m3e/gestures/long-press";

const recognizer = longPress({ minDuration: 500 });
recognizer.addListener((detail) => console.log(detail.duration));
```

## Declarative usage

```ts
import "m3e/gestures/long-press";
```

```html
<div id="item"></div>
<m3e-long-press-gesture for="item"></m3e-long-press-gesture>
```

The element dispatches a `gesture` event with `LongPressGestureDetail` as its detail.
