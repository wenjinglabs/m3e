# m3e/gestures/scale

Recognizes pinch and spread movement made by multiple pointers.

```ts
import { scale } from "m3e/gestures/scale";

const recognizer = scale({ pointers: 2 });
recognizer.addListener((detail) => console.log(detail.scale));
```

## Declarative usage

```ts
import "m3e/gestures/scale";
```

```html
<div id="canvas"></div>
<m3e-scale-gesture for="canvas"></m3e-scale-gesture>
```

The element dispatches a `gesture` event with `ScaleGestureDetail` as its detail.
