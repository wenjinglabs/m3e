# m3e/gestures/swipe

Recognizes fast directional pointer movement.

```ts
import { swipe } from "m3e/gestures/swipe";

const recognizer = swipe({ minVelocity: 0.3 });
recognizer.addListener((detail) => console.log(detail.direction));
```

## Declarative usage

```ts
import "m3e/gestures/swipe";
```

```html
<div id="surface"></div>
<m3e-swipe-gesture for="surface"></m3e-swipe-gesture>
```

The element dispatches a `gesture` event with `SwipeGestureDetail` as its detail.
