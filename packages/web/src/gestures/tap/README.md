# m3e/gestures/tap

Recognizes a short press and release with limited pointer movement.

```ts
import { tap } from "m3e/gestures/tap";

const recognizer = tap((detail) => {
  console.log(detail.gestureName, detail.clientX, detail.clientY);
});
```

## Declarative usage

```ts
import "m3e/gestures/tap";
```

```html
<button id="save">Save</button> <m3e-tap-gesture for="save"></m3e-tap-gesture>
```

The element dispatches a `gesture` event with `TapGestureDetail` as its detail.
