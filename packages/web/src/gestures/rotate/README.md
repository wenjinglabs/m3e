# m3e/gestures/rotate

Recognizes rotation made by multiple pointers.

```ts
import { rotate } from "m3e/gestures/rotate";

const recognizer = rotate({ pointers: 2 });
recognizer.addListener((detail) => console.log(detail.rotation));
```

## Declarative usage

```ts
import "m3e/gestures/rotate";
```

```html
<div id="canvas"></div>
<m3e-rotate-gesture for="canvas"></m3e-rotate-gesture>
```

The element dispatches a `gesture` event with `RotateGestureDetail` as its detail.
