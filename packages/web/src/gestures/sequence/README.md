# m3e/gestures/sequence

Recognizes multiple child gestures in a required order. The sequence completes only when every child recognizer completes; a failed child cancels the sequence.

```ts
import { sequence } from "m3e/gestures/sequence";
import { longPress } from "m3e/gestures/long-press";
import { tap } from "m3e/gestures/tap";

const recognizer = sequence(longPress(), tap());
```

## Declarative usage

```ts
import "m3e/gestures/sequence";
import "m3e/gestures/long-press";
import "m3e/gestures/tap";
```

```html
<div id="canvas"></div>
<m3e-sequence-gesture for="canvas">
  <m3e-long-press-gesture></m3e-long-press-gesture>
  <m3e-tap-gesture></m3e-tap-gesture>
</m3e-sequence-gesture>
```

The element dispatches a `gesture` event with `SequenceGestureDetail` as its detail. Child gesture elements are processed in DOM order.
