# m3e/gestures/transform

Provides low-level pointer transformation details, including translation, scale, and rotation. It is the base recognizer used by pan, scale, and rotate.

```ts
import { transform } from "m3e/gestures/transform";

const recognizer = transform({ pointers: 2 });
recognizer.addListener((detail) => {
  console.log(detail.translationX, detail.translationY, detail.scale, detail.rotation);
});
```

## Declarative usage

```ts
import "m3e/gestures/transform";
```

```html
<div id="canvas"></div>
<m3e-transform-gesture for="canvas"></m3e-transform-gesture>
```

The element dispatches a `gesture` event with `TransformGestureDetail` as its detail.
