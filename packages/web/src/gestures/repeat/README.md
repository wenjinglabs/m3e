# m3e/gestures/repeat

Recognizes one child gesture repeatedly. Recognition completes after the configured number of occurrences.

```ts
import { repeat } from "m3e/gestures/repeat";
import { tap } from "m3e/gestures/tap";

const doubleTap = repeat({ count: 2 }, tap());
doubleTap.addListener((detail) => {
  console.log(detail.details.length);
});
```

## Declarative usage

```ts
import "m3e/gestures/repeat";
import "m3e/gestures/tap";
```

```html
<div id="surface"></div>
<m3e-repeat-gesture for="surface" count="2">
  <m3e-tap-gesture></m3e-tap-gesture>
</m3e-repeat-gesture>
```

The element dispatches a `gesture` event with `RepeatGestureDetail` as its detail. The first assigned child gesture is used as the repeated recognizer.
