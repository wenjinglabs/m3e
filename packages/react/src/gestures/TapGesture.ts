 * React binding for the `m3e-tap-gesture` Web Component from `m3e/gestures/tap`.
 *
 * This component renders the underlying `<m3e-tap-gesture>` element and exposes its
 * properties, attributes, and events through an idiomatic React interface.
 *
 * Props map directly to element properties, and event handlers receive the
 * native DOM events dispatched by the component. Refs are forwarded to the
 * underlying `<m3e-tap-gesture>` instance for imperative access.
 *
 * See the `m3e-tap-gesture` documentation for full details on behavior, styling,
 * accessibility, and supported events.
